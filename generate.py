"""
Stage 5 of the pipeline: writing the answer.

This is the only part of your system that calls out to a service. Everything
else runs on your laptop.

Every outgoing call in this course goes through `generate()` below. That
matters for a practical reason: the free tier allows only a small number of
calls per minute, and a previous cohort ran into that wall hard. Rather than
asking three hundred students to each write their own pacing code, the pacing
lives here, once.

What this function does for you:

  • Paces requests so you stay under the per-minute limit, and tells you when
    it's waiting. A pause is the limiter doing its job, not a hang.
  • Caches repeated prompts while you're building, so re-running the same
    question twenty times while you debug costs one call.
  • Stops with a warning if a session goes through an unreasonable number of
    calls, instead of silently draining your whole day's allowance.
  • Retries when the service says you're going too fast.
  • Counts your calls, and the tokens they used, so what a run cost is a
    number you can see rather than one you estimate.

⚠️ Caching is ON while you build and OFF during evaluation. Your unit 2
testing needs three real answers to the same question, not one answer three
times over.
`run_eval.py` passes cache=False for you.
